*Graph 1*

#### 1. What is the degree of node 7?
0 because node 7 isn't connected to any other node with an edge.
#### 2. If A is the adjacency matrix representation for the undirected graph, what is the value of A[2,6]

*Adjacency matrix representing Graph 1*
A[2,6] is the integer in the second row and sixth column, which is 0

#### 3. What is the Python dictionary representation of the degree distribution  for Graph 1
dict = {0:3, 1:3, 2:3, 3:2, 4:2, 5:1, 6:4, 7:0}
