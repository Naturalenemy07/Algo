*Graph 1*

#### 1. What is the degree of node 7?
0 because node 7 isn't connected to any other node with an edge.
#### 2. If A is the adjacency matrix representation for the undirected graph, what is the value of A[2,6]

![equation]\begin{bmatrix}01001010\\10100010\\01010010\\00100010\\10000000\\00001000\\11110000\\00000000\end{bmatrix}

#### 3. What is the Python dictionary representation of the degree distribution  for Graph 1
